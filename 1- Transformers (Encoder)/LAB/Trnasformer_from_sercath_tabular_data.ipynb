        "## 1. Understanding Transformers\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we dive into the code, it's important to understand what a **Transformer** is and why it works so well for various tasks, including tabular data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Transformer** architecture was introduced in the paper [\"Attention is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and revolutionized tasks like NLP, but can be applied to other types of data too.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Self-Attention**: A mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different input tokens/positions for each input token.\n",
        "- **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.\n",
        "- **Feed Forward Network (FFN)**: After attention, the transformed inputs pass through fully connected layers to learn further representations.\n",
        "- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes the input to each layer for better training stability.\n",
        "- **Residual Connections**: Adds input back to the output of a layer, preventing the loss of information during transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Use Transformers for Tabular Data?\n",
        "- Tabular data often contains both categorical and numerical features.\n",
        "- A transformer’s ability to learn **relationships** between features can be helpful for structured data.\n",
        "- It allows each feature to \"attend\" to other features.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Implementing Multi-Head Self-Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Self-Attention?\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-attention allows each feature (or token in NLP) to focus on other features while processing, providing a context. For example, in a tabular dataset, if we are processing the \"age\" feature, self-attention helps the model figure out the influence of other features (like \"blood pressure\" or \"cholesterol\") on the target.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multi-Head Self-Attention:\n",

    "\n",
    "For this task, you will be working with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Checkpoint**: Use the pre-trained model checkpoint `bert-base-uncased` for both the model and tokenizer.\n",
    "- **Dataset**: You will be using the `CUTD/math_df` dataset. Ensure to load and preprocess the dataset correctly for training and evaluation.\n",

    "**Note:**\n",
    "- Any additional steps or methods you include that improve or enhance the results will be rewarded with bonus points if they are justified.\n",
    "- The steps outlined here are suggestions. You are free to implement alternative methods or approaches to achieve the task, as long as you explain the reasoning and the process at the bottom of the notebook.\n",
    "- You can use either TensorFlow or PyTorch for this task. If you prefer TensorFlow, feel free to use it when working with Hugging Face Transformers.\n",
    "- The number of data samples you choose to work with is flexible. However, if you select a very low number of samples and the training time is too short, this could affect the evaluation of your work."
